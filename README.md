# hs-final-project
My final project for high school cs.


This project is a game built in C# using [Monogame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame).
The server holds data on the users as well as the games they have played. The manager client let's the admins view, update, and delete user data.
The games UI was built using [Myra](https://github.com/rds1983/Myra).

The game itself is a simple dungeon crawler (if you can call it that). You need to kill both enemies and then step on the red tile to traverse the dungeon (which you will notice is the same because i couldn't get the procedural map generator i was using to work. It is kinda barebones but it is only a proof of concept being a final project.

Assets for the game were ripped by Vaati, Someone, and Dasani on [spriters-resource.com](https://www.spriters-resource.com).
